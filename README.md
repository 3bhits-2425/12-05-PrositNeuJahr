Project RoboBomb from Luca Moldovan, Mirza Dzinic and David Gildinger!

The project Robobomb is rocket launcher, that launches the rockets when pressing space. The rockets explode after between 4-6 seconds and change their color randomly. 
We used the Rigidbody physics for making it more realistic. The launcher was made by ourselves and the explosion as the rocket prefab are from Assetstore.
